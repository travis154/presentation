the green constitution
	a modern constitution for a modern maldives
	separation of powers
	this includes the president, judiciary and majlis as main main powers
	this includes several other independent commissions (elections commission, hr commission, police, anti corruption...etc)
	with 83 years of constitutional changes we have developed the constitution
	and it's not complete
	it will never be complete
functions of majlis
	1. Formulating, amending and abolishing laws.
	2. Amending the constitution.
	3. Holding the government accountable by supervision of policies and actions.
	4. Approval of State Budget.
	5. Holding public referendums.
	6. Determination of matters related to independent commissions and independent offices.	
with all of this the question rises,
	can a mp build the harbour in my island?
	will the mp pay for my medical expenses?
	...etc
no, mp can't do any of this
it should be done by the executive powers
mps can facilitate to make those
mps can push the government to make that happen
can an independent canidate do that?
yes, we've seen in the current majlis (take zubair as an example)
i will give my full support for any bill that's for the betterment of my people and the people of maldives
will i sign to a political party? no
